        .NET and Unity. Due to hardware limitations of those devices, I learned how to write highly optimized and 
        multithreaded code. I was also tasked with desiging, writing and implementing many core features and components
        that were essential parts of the framework. Some of these include a label system (similar to Google Maps), automatic 
        mesh generation for GIS data, and much more. */}
