        researching low-level networking solutions for VR devices and building UI components.\
        After my internship ended, I was hired on full-time to work on their main client facing projects. I was responsible\
        for designing and implementing many core features that became part of the main platform. Some examples\
        include but not limited to: an automatic GeoJSON to mesh converter, label engine, Google Earth style camera system,\
        save/load system, and a dynamic menu system made with Unity's UI toolkit. I had the opportunity to learn how to write\
        extremely optimized code to maintain high framrates, and leverage multi-threading in performance critical areas."
