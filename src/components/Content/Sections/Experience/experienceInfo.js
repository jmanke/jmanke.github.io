        // worked on their main projects. Many of the components and modules I wrote became\
        // part of the core framework, which were written in C# using .NET and Unity. Performance was always a challenge\
        // when working on VR devices and the Microsoft Hololens; therefore, I became adept at writing optimized code and\
        // leveraged multi-threading where possible."
